# 100_days_of_Python

Hey! Thaks for stopping by! My name is Tiffany but you can call me Tip....Im currently learning Python and I will be using this repo to kep track of my projects, notes and code snippets...

I will be completing the [100 Days of Code Ultimate Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/share/103IHM/) by Angela Yu

For my code editor I will be using the community version of [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=mac) for mac

Links to test each of my projects will be in the README section of each days file. As I learn more skills and concepts I may add to these projects in the future.
Thanks for stopping by happy coding!
