# 100_days_of_Python

# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Iâ€™m Tiffany but you can call me Tip! I'm a newbie developer and Python enthusiast on a journey to learn, build, and (hopefully) create something amazing. This is where Iâ€™ll share my projects, experiments, and coding adventures as I dive deeper into the world of python.

## About Me  
I'm a wife to an amazing husband and sahm to 6 crazy kiddos. For about 15 years I worked in healthcare both in direct patient care and on the administrative side.
I recently decided to learn Python because Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by technology and its ability to solve real-world problems. My goal is to:

- Help people create useful solutions for their challenges.
- Build something innovative and, letâ€™s face it, **really cool**! ðŸš€
- Be a part of projects that can make a meaningful impact and even change lives.

Iâ€™m currently working through the [100 Days of Code Ultimate Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/share/103IHM/) by Angela Yu, and itâ€™s been an incredible learning experience so far. Iâ€™ll be documenting my progress and sharing projects along the way, so feel free to follow along!
Links to test each of my projects will be in the README section of each days file and as I learn more skills and concepts I may add to these projects in the future.

## What Iâ€™m Excited to Learn

Here are some things I canâ€™t wait to explore:

- **Python basics:** Building a solid foundation in coding fundamentals. 
- **Data analysis and visualization:** Turning numbers into stories and insights. 
- **Web development:** Creating interactive and accessible web applications. 
- **Automation:** Making everyday tasks easier with creative Python scripts.

And, of course, discovering all the fun, unexpected ways I can use Python to build solutions that matter.

## What Youâ€™ll Find Here

On this profile, youâ€™ll find:

- Beginner-friendly projects (because we all start somewhere!).
- Notes and reflections from my learning journey.
- Resources Iâ€™ve found helpful while diving into Python and development.

As I grow, Iâ€™ll add more advanced projects and showcase solutions Iâ€™ve built to tackle real-world problems.
