Band Name Generator Day 1 Project

#For this project we had to complete the following:
#1. Create a greeting for the program
#2. Ask the user to pick a city; save it as a variable
#3. Ask the user to pick a pet name; save it as a variable
#4. Combine the city and pet name to display the band name

#this project is simple and straight forward and should demonstrate the understanding and use of:
# - creating and using variables
# - concatination
# - print statements
# - string manipulation
# - commenting
